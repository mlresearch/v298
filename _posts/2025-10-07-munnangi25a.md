title: 'FactEHR: A Dataset for Evaluating Factuality in Clinical Notes Using LLMs'
abstract: Verifying and attributing factual claims is essential for the safe and effective
  use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare. A core component of factuality
  evaluation is fact decompositionâ€”the process of breaking down complex clinical statements
  into fine-grained, atomic facts for verification. Recent work has proposed fact
  decomposition, which uses LLMs to rewrite source text into concise sentences conveying
  a single piece of information, as an approach for fine-grained fact verification,
  in the general domain. However, clinical documentation poses unique challenges for
  fact decomposition due to dense terminology and diverse note types and remains understudied.
  To address this gap and to explore these challenges, we present FactEHR, an NLI
  dataset consisting of full document fact decompositions for 2,168 clinical notes
  spanning four types from three hospital systems resulting in 987,266 entailment
  pairs. We asses the generated facts on different axes, from entailment evaluation
  of LLMs to a qualitative analysis. Our evaluation, including review by clinicians,
  highlights significant variability in the performance of LLMs for fact decom- position
  from Gemini generating highly relevant and factually correct facts to Llama-3 generating
  fewer and inconsistent facts. The results underscore the need for better LLM capabilities
  to support factual verification in clinical text. To facilitate further research,
  we release anonymized code and plan to make the dataset available upon acceptance.
