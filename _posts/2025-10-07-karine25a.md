title: Enhancing Adaptive Behavioral Interventions with LLM Inference from Participant
  Described States
abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
  change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of significant
  interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on problems such as
  smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion. However, RL methods are
  often applied to these domains using a small collection of context variables to
  mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that arise from practical limitations
  on the design of adaptive intervention trials. In this paper, we explore an approach
  to significantly expanding the state space of an adaptive intervention without impacting
  data efficiency. The proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide
  natural language descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages
  inference with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy
  of a base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we develop
  a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that generates text-based
  state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables using an auxiliary LLM.
  We show that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance
  of online policy learning methods.
