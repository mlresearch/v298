title: 'Borrowing From the Future: Enhancing Early Risk Assessment through Contrastive
  Learning'
abstract: Risk assessment in pediatric populations often requires analysis across
  multiple developmental stages. For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally,
  at birth, and during WellChild visits. While predictions at later stages typically
  achieve higher accuracy, it is clinically desirable to make reliable risk assessments
  as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on enhancing prediction performance
  in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution, **Borrowing From the Future (BFF)**,
  is a contrastive multi-modal framework that treats each time window as a distinct
  modality. In BFF, a model is trained on all available data throughout the time while
  conduct risk assessment using the up-to-time information. This contrastive framework
  allows the model to "borrow" informative signals from later stages (e.g., WellChild
  visits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g., prenatal/birth
  stages). We validate BFF on two real-world pediatric outcome prediction tasks, demonstrating
  consistent improvements in early risk assessment.
