title: 'MedArabiQ: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Arabic Medical Tasks'
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various
  applications in healthcare. However, their effectiveness in the Arabic medical domain
  remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and
  benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a new benchmark dataset consisting
  of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple
  choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first
  constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets.
  We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities,
  including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with seven state-of-the-art
  open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini
  1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks
  that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs
  in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide
  a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual
  capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.
