title: 'Equitable Electronic Health Record Prediction with FAME: Fairness-Aware Multimodal
  Embedding'
abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompasses diverse modalities—text,
  images, and medical codes—that are vital for clinical decision-making. To process
  these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful approach for fusing
  such information. However, most existing MAI models optimize for better prediction
  performance, potentially reinforcing biases across patient subgroups. Although bias
  reduction techniques for multimodal models have been proposed, the individual strengths
  of each modality and their interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance
  remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal
  Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its
  fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by incorporating
  a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution Disparity Index (EDDI)
  to measure fairness across subgroups and propose an RMS-based (root mean square)
  aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring equitable model
  outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT, combining structured
  and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of performance
  and fairness compared to other baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks.
