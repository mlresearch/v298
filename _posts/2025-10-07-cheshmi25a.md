title: Improving Out-of-distribution Human Activity Recognition via IMU-Video Cross-modal
  Representation Learning
abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays
  a critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
  the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
  enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as needed.
  Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using Inertial Measurement
  Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on application-specific labels and lack generalizability
  to data collected in different environments or populations. To address this limitation,
  we propose a new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
  from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved generalizability
  in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets, including a dataset collected
  from patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Specifically, our results indicate that
  the proposed cross-modal pretraining approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art
  IMU-video pretraining approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot
  evaluations. Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
  such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn generalizable
  data representations.
