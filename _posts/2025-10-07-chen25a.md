title: The Impact of Image Resolution on Biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models
abstract: 'Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
  medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various modalities.
  While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for biomedical image
  analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from general-purpose datasets,
  risking critical information loss. We investigate how image resolution affects MLLM
  performance in biomedical applications and demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution
  training and inference significantly improve performance across multiple tasks,
  (2) misalignment between training and inference resolutions severely degrades performance,
  and (3) mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
  computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these findings,
  we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets
  to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative impact in scientific research and
  clinical applications.'
