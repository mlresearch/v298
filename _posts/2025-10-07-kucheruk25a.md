title: Optimizing Segmentation of Neonatal Brain MRIs with Partially Annotated Multi-Label
  Data
abstract: Accurate assessment of the developing brain is important for research and
  clinical applications, and manual segmentation of brain MRIs is a painstaking and
  expensive process. We introduce the first method for neonatal brain MRI segmentation
  that simultaneously leverages fully and partially labeled data within a multi-label
  segmentation framework. Our method improves accuracy and efficiency by utilizing
  all available supervision—even when only coarse or incomplete annotations are present—enabling
  the model to learn both detailed and high-level brain structures from heterogeneous
  data. We validate our method on scans from the Developing Human Connectome Project
  (dHCP) acquired at both preterm and term gestational ages. Our approach demonstrates
  more accurate and robust segmentation compared to standard supervised and semi-supervised
  models trained with equivalent data. The results showed an improvement in predictions
  of predominantly unannotated labels in the training set when combined with labels
  of relevant "super-classes". Further experiments with semi-supervised loss functions
  demonstrated that limited but reliable supervision is more effective than using
  noisy labels. Our work presents evidence that it is possible to build robust medical
  image segmentation models with only a small amount of fully labeled training data.
