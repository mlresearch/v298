title: 'INSIGHT: Explainable Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Analysis'
abstract: Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images
  (WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then
  an aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require
  post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM)  and often fail to localize small
  yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT,
  a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive
  bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module
  with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with
  a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal
  heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT
  achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic
  segmentation performance.
