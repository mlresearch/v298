title: 'ECG-Byte: A Tokenizer for End-to-End Generative Electrocardiogram Language
  Modeling'
abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility
  across domains, including applications to electrocardiograms (ECGs). A growing body
  of work focuses on generating text from multi-channeled ECG signals and corresponding
  textual prompts. Existing approaches often involve a two-stage process: pretraining
  an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective, followed
  by finetuning an LLM for natural language generation (NLG) using encoder-derived
  features. However, these methods face two key limitations: inefficiency due to multi-stage
  training and challenges in interpreting encoder-generated features. To overcome
  these issues, we propose ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer
  pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. ECG-Byte compresses and encodes
  ECG signals into tokens, enabling direct end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG
  and text tokens. This approach enhances interpretability, as ECG tokens can be directly
  mapped back to the original signals. Leveraging ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive
  NLG performance while training 3 times faster and using just 48% of the data required
  by traditional two-stage methods.'
