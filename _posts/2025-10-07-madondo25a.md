title: Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck
  Cancer Proton Therapy
abstract: Anatomical changes in head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients during intensity-modulated
  proton therapy (IMPT) can shift the Bragg Peak of proton beams, risking tumor underdosing
  and organ-at-risk (OAR) overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
  to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual replanning
  processes are often resource-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we propose
  a patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
  replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
  score designed to handle the competing clinical objectives in radiotherapy planning.
  We formulate the planning process as an RL problem where agents learn high-dimensional
  control policies to adjust plan optimization priorities to maximize plan quality.
  Unlike population-based approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for
  each patient using their planning CT and augmented anatomies simulating anatomical
  changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific approach leverages
  anatomical similarities along the treatment course, enabling effective plan adaptation.
  We implemented and compared two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal
  Policy Optimization (PPO), using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state representations
  and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments. Evaluation on five
  HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed that both DRL agents improved
  initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm 6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74
  \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing the replans manually generated by a human planner ($137.20
  \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms these improvements translate to better
  tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse anatomical changes. This work highlights
  the potential of DRL in addressing the geometric and dosimetric complexities of
  adaptive proton therapy, offering a promising solution for efficient offline adaptation
  and paving the way for online adaptive proton therapy.
