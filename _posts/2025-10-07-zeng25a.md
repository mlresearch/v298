title: 'TrajSurv: Learning Continuous Latent Trajectories from Electronic Health Records
  for Trustworthy Survival Prediction'
abstract: Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making.
  Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity
  for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous
  clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features
  and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these
  challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories
  from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs
  a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent
  states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories.
  To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns
  the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive
  learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome,
  TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation
  process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into
  the latent trajectory’s evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters
  these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated
  with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world medical datasets,
  MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv’s competitive accuracy and superior transparency
  over existing deep learning methods.
