title: 'Classifying Copy Number Variations Using State Space Modeling of Targeted
  Sequencing Data: A Case Study in Thalassemia'
abstract: Thalassemia, a blood disorder and one of the most prevalent hereditary genetic
  disorders worldwide, is often caused by copy number variations (CNVs) in the hemoglobin
  genes. This disorder has incredible diversity, with a large number of distinct profiles
  corresponding to alterations of different regions in the genes. Correctly classifying
  an individual’s profile is critical as it impacts treatment, prognosis, and genetic
  counseling. However, genetic classification is challenging due to the large number
  of profiles worldwide, and often requires a large number of sequential tests. Targeted
  next generation sequencing (NGS), which characterizes segments of an individual’s
  genome, has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of testing and increase
  accuracy. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic state space model for profiling
  thalassemia from targeted NGS data, which naturally characterize the spatial ordering
  of the genes along the chromosome. We then use decision theory to choose the best
  profile among the different options. Due to our use of Bayesian methodology, we
  are also able to detect low-quality samples to be excluded from consideration, an
  important component of clinical screening. We evaluate our model on a dataset of
  57 individuals, including both controls and cases with a variety of thalassemia
  profiles. Our model has a sensitivity of $0.99$ and specificity of $0.93$ for thalassemia
  detection, and accuracy of $91.5%$ for characterizing subtypes. Furthermore, the
  specificity and accuracy rise to $0.96$ and $93.9%$ when low-quality samples are
  excluded using our automated quality control method. This approach outperforms alternative
  methods, particularly in specificity, and is broadly applicable to other disorders.
