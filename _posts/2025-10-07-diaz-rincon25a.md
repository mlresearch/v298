title: 'Uncertainty-Aware Prediction of Parkinson’s Disease Medication Needs: A Two-Stage
  Conformal Prediction Approach'
abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges
  due to heterogeneous disease progression, symptoms,  and treatment response. Neurologists
  must balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic medication dosing based on
  functional disability while minimizing risks of side effects. This balance is crucial
  as inadequate or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), wearing
  off, and neuropsychiatric side effects, significantly reducing quality of life.
  Current approaches rely on trial-and-error decision-making without systematic predictive
  methods. Despite machine learning advances in medication forecasting, clinical adoption
  remains limited due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
  uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. To facilitate trust, clinicians
  require not only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
  measures. Without quantified uncertainty, medication adjustments risk premature
  escalation to maximum doses or prolonged periods of inadequate symptom control.
  To address this challenge, we developed a conformal prediction framework anticipating
  medication needs up to two years in advance with reliable prediction intervals and
  statistical guarantees. Our approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data,
  where patients maintain stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic
  health records data from 631 inpatient admissions at XYZ (2011-2021), our novel
  two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then predicts
  required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework achieved marginal
  coverage while significantly reducing prediction interval lengths compared to traditional
  approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term planning and appropriately
  wider ranges for long-term forecasting, matching the increasing uncertainty in extended
  projections. By quantifying uncertainty in medication needs, our approach enables
  evidence-based decisions about levodopa dosing and medication adjustments, potentially
  optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving patients’
  quality of life.
