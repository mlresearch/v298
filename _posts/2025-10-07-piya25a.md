title: 'ConTextual: Improving Clinical Text Summarization in LLMs with Context-preserving
  Token Filtering and Knowledge Graphs'
abstract: Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of information
  that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most pertinent context
  from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and
  timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various
  methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input
  tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced
  clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In
  this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving
  Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual
  augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them
  with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical
  fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate
  that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach
  highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval
  in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable
  solution for improving precision in clinical text generation.
