title: Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health
  Records
abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers,
  and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific
  symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach
  that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory
  measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior
  to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines Neural Controlled Differential Equations
  to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks
  to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms
  to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our
  approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant
  improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore,
  our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated
  PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.
