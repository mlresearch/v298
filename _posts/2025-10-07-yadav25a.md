title: 'Monte Carlo ExtremalMask: Uncertainty Aware Time Series Model Interpretability
  For Critical Care Applications'
abstract: Model interpretability for biomedical time-series contexts (e.g., critical
  care medicine) remains a significant challenge where interactions between pathophysiological
  signals obscure clinical interpretations. Traditional feature-time attribution methods
  for time series generate static, deterministic saliency masks, which fail to account
  for the temporal uncertainty and probabilistic nature of model-inferred feature
  importance in dynamic physiological systems such as acute organ failure. We address
  this limitation by proposing a probabilistic framework leveraging Monte Carlo Dropout
  to quantify model-centric epistemic uncertainty in attribution masks. We capture
  the stochastic variability through iterative sampling, though the inherent randomness
  introduces inconsistency in mask outputs across sampling iterations. We implement
  a dual optimization strategy incorporating entropy minimization and spatiotemporal
  variance regularization during training to ensure the convergence of attribution
  masks toward higher informativeness and lower entropy while preserving uncertainty
  quantification. This approach provides a systematic way to prioritize feature-time
  pairs by balancing high attribution scores with low uncertainty estimates, enabling
  end users to discover clinical biomarkers for time-dependent pathophysiological
  deterioration of patient state. Our work advances the field of healthcare machine
  learning by formalizing uncertainty-aware interpretability for temporal models while
  bridging the gap between probabilistic attributions and clinically actionable interpretations
  for problems in critical care.
