title: 'ScaffoldGPT: A Scaffold-based GPT Model for Drug Optimization'
abstract: 'Drug optimization has become increasingly crucial in light of fast-mutating
  virus strains and drug-resistant cancer cells. Nevertheless, it remains challenging
  as it necessitates retaining the beneficial properties of the original drug while
  simultaneously enhancing desired attributes beyond its scope. In this work, we aim
  to tackle this challenge by introducing ScaffoldGPT, a novel Generative Pretrained
  Transformer (GPT) designed for drug optimization based on molecular scaffolds. Our
  work comprises three key components: (1) A three-stage drug optimization approach
  that integrates pretraining, finetuning, and decoding optimization. (2) A uniquely
  designed two-phase incremental training approach for pre-training the drug optimization
  GPT on molecule scaffold with enhanced performance. (3) A token-level decoding optimization
  strategy, Top-N, that enabling controlled, reward guided generation using pretrained/finetuned
  GPT. We demonstrate via a comprehensive evaluation on COVID and cancer benchmarks
  that ScaffoldGPT outperforms the competing baselines in drug optimization benchmarks,
  while excelling in preserving original functional scaffold and enhancing desired
  properties.'
