title: Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic Trajectories
  with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model
abstract: The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing
  dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement
  via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event
  modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility,
  resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability,
  which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve
  upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions
  are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network,
  in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with
  many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable
  than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility
  for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize
  the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions
  in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset,
  and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children diagnosis
  dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact
  kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other
  data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss
  of performance.
