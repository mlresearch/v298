title: 'ProtoECGNet: Case-Based Interpretable Deep Learning for Multi-Label ECG Classification
  with Contrastive Learning'
abstract: 'Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive
  performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and
  faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect
  a model’s true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent
  alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real
  ECG segments—enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet,
  a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification.
  ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical
  interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm
  classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning,
  and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained
  with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation,
  diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between
  prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring
  diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset,
  demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models
  while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality,
  we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model’s projected prototypes,
  finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that
  prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series
  classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep
  learning models for clinical decision support.'
