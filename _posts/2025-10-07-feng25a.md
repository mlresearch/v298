title: 'Error Profiling of Machine Learning Models: An Exploratory Visualization'
abstract: 'While data-driven predictive models are increasingly used in healthcare,
  their clinical translation remains limited—partly due to challenges in evaluating
  model performance across design choices. Existing explainability methods often focus
  on intra-model interpretability but fall short in supporting inter-model comparisons.
  We present a visualization-based error profiling method that facilitates comparative
  evaluation by highlighting overlaps and differences in model predictions. Our matrix-based
  visualization maps which models incorrectly classify which patient subgroups, with
  color intensity indicating the number of misclassified patients. This approach enables
  deeper insight into which (sub)populations are consistently (in)correctly classified
  across models, helping uncover patterns of model (dis)agreement and assess the impact
  of modeling decisions.  We demonstrate our visualization method in four healthcare
  use cases: 1) missing data imputation in a longitudinal nutritional dataset; 2)
  feature set analysis using randomized controlled trial data; 3) end-model technical
  performance in cardiac morbidity prediction; and 4) data modality comparison using
  a dual-source lung cancer dataset with longitudinal and radiomic features. To evaluate
  the visualization, we obtained expert feedback and qualitative assessments of decision-making
  insights. Survey results—across clinicians, computer scientists, and medical informaticians—indicated
  that our method provides an interpretable and intuitive way to compare model error
  distributions by highlighting patterns within correctly and incorrectly classified
  subpopulations across different models. Our comprehensible error profiling approach
  represents an initial step toward a systematic framework for improving model assessment
  in clinical tasks. Through this framework, both model developers and end users can
  better understand when and where a given model is appropriate for real-world clinical
  deployment.'
