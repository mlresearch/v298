title: 'FIVA: Federated Inverse Variance Averaging for Universal CT Segmentation with
  Uncertainty Estimation'
abstract: Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different
  scanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels
  for a limited and often disjoint set of organs.  Using these heterogeneous data
  effectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work presents
  a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation across diverse
  abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for aggregation and predictive
  uncertainty for inference.  Our approach leverages the inherent noise in stochastic
  mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a distribution over the model weights to
  provide an on-the-go uncertainty over the model parameters at the client level.
  The parameters are then aggregated at the server using the additional uncertainty
  information using a Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme.  Furthermore,
  the proposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the uncertainty
  from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for clinical decision-making.
  Consistent with recent work shown, predictive uncertainty is utilized in the inference
  stage to improve predictive performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the
  effectiveness of this approach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation
  and the uncertainty-weighted inference as compared to the previously established
  baselines.
