title: 'MedPatch: Confidence-Guided Multi-Stage Fusion for Multimodal Clinical Data'
abstract: 'Clinical decision-making relies on the integration of information across
  various data modalities, such as clinical time-series, medical images and textual
  reports. Compared to other domains, real-world medical data is heterogeneous in
  nature, limited in size, and sparse due to missing modalities. This significantly
  limits model performance in clinical prediction tasks. Inspired by clinical workflows,
  we introduce MedPatch, a multi-stage multimodal fusion architecture, which seamlessly
  integrates multiple modalities via confidence-guided patching. MedPatch comprises
  three main components: (i) a multi-stage fusion strategy that leverages joint and
  late fusion simultaneously, (ii) a missingness-aware module that handles sparse
  samples with missing modalities, (iii) a joint fusion module that clusters latent
  token patches based on calibrated unimodal token-level confidence. We evaluated
  MedPatch using real-world data consisting of clinical time-series data, chest X-ray
  images, radiology reports, and discharge notes extracted from the MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR,
  and MIMIC-Notes datasets on two benchmark tasks, namely in-hospital mortality prediction
  and clinical condition classification. Compared to existing baselines, MedPatch
  achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work highlights the effectiveness of
  confidence-guided multi-stage fusion in addressing the heterogeneity of multimodal
  data, and establishes new state-of-the-art benchmark results for clinical prediction
  tasks.'
