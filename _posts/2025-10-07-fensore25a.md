title: Does Domain-Specific Retrieval Augmented Generation Help LLMs Answer Consumer
  Health Questions?
abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
  medical benchmarks, there remains uncertainty about whether retrieval-augmented
  generation (RAG) meaningfully improves their ability to answer consumer health questions.
  In this study, we systematically evaluate vanilla LLMs against RAG-enhanced approaches
  using the NIDDK portion of the MedQuAD dataset. We compare four open-source LLMs
  in both vanilla and RAG configurations, assessing performance through automated
  metrics, LLM-based evaluation, and clinical validation. Surprisingly, we find that
  vanilla LLM approaches consistently outperform RAG variants across both quantitative
  metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) and qualitative assessments. The relatively low
  retrieval performance (Precision@5 = 0.15) highlights fundamental challenges in
  implementing effective RAG systems for medical question-answering, even with carefully
  curated questions. While RAG showed competitive performance in specific areas like
  scientific consensus and harm reduction, our findings suggest that successful implementation
  of RAG for consumer health question-answering requires more sophisticated approaches
  than simple retrieval and prompt engineering. These results contribute to the ongoing
  discussion about the role of retrieval augmentation in medical AI systems and highlight
  the need for medical-specific RAG infrastructure to enhance medical question-answering
  systems.
