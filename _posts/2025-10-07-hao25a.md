title: Stage-Aware Event-Based Modeling (SA-EBM) for Disease Progression
abstract: 'As diseases progress, the number of cognitive and biological biomarkers
  they impact increases. By formulating probabilistic models with this basic assumption,
  Event-Based Models (EBMs) enable researchers to discover the progression of a disease
  that makes earlier diagnosis and effective clinical interventions possible. We build
  on prior EBMs with two major improvements: (1) dynamic estimation of healthy and
  pathological biomarker distributions, and (2) explicit modeling of the distribution
  of disease stages. We tested existing approaches and our novel approach on a benchmark
  of 9,000 synthetic datasets, inspired from real-world data. We found that our stage-aware
  EBM (SA-EBM) significantly outperforms prior methods, such as Gaussian Mixture Model
  (GMM) EBM, Kernel Density Estimation EBM and Discriminative EBM, on ordering and
  staging tasks.'
