title: Can interpretability and accuracy coexist in cancer survival analysis?
abstract: Survival analysis refers to statistical procedures used to analyze data
  that focuses on the time until an event occurs, such as death in cancer patients.
  Traditionally, the linear Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model is widely used due
  to its inherent interpretability. CPH model help identify key disease-associated
  factors (through feature weights), providing insights into patient risk of death.
  However, their reliance on linear assumptions limits their ability to capture the
  complex, non-linear relationships present in real-world data. To overcome this,
  more advanced models, such as neural networks, have been introduced, offering significantly
  improved predictive accuracy. However, these gains come at the expense of interpretability,
  which is essential for clinical trust and practical application. To address the
  trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability in survival analysis,
  we propose ConSurv, a concept bottleneck model that maintains state-of-the-art performance
  while providing transparent and interpretable insights. Using gene expression and
  clinical data from breast cancer patients, ConSurv captures complex feature interactions
  and predicts patient risk. By offering clear, biologically meaningful explanations
  for each prediction, ConSurv attempts to build trust among clinicians and researchers
  in using the model for informed decision-making.
