title: Biomedical Hypothesis Explainability with Graph-Based Context Retrieval
abstract: 'We introduce an explainability method for biomedical hypothesis generation
  systems, built on the the novel Hypothesis Generation Context Refiner framework.
  Our approach combines semantic graph-based retrieval, and relevant data-restrictive
  training to simulate real-world discovery constraints. Integrated with large language
  models (LLMs) via retrieval-augmented generation, the system explains hypotheses
  in contextual evidence using published scientific literature. We propose a novel
  feedback loop approach, which iteratively identifies and corrects flawed parts of
  LLM-generated explanations, refining both the evidence paths and supporting papers.
  We demonstrate the performance of our method with multiple large language models
  and evaluate explanation and context retrieval quality through both expert-curated
  assessment and large-scale automated analysis.\\{Reproducibility}: our code and
  data are  available at [link will be added upon acceptance]'
