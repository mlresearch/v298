title: Evaluation of Multi-Agent LLMs in Multidisciplinary Team Decision-Making for
  Challenging Cancer Cases
abstract: This study explores the potential of large language model (LLM) agents in
  real-world clinical decision-making, focusing on their alignment with human experts
  in cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings. While LLMs perform well on benchmark
  medical question-answering tasks, these evaluations often oversimplify the open-ended,
  multifaceted nature of actual clinical decisions. In practice, MDTs require balancing
  diverse expert opinions and multiple valid treatment options. Using real MDT meeting
  data, we compare different LLM approaches including single-agent and multi-agent
  systems to assess their ability to replicate consensus-based decisions. Our findings
  indicate that multi-agent, conversation-based systems, which assign specialized
  roles and facilitate dynamic inter-agent conversation, better approximate human
  expert decisions in our data. Overall, this work highlights the potential practical
  utility of LLM agents in complex clinical settings and lays the groundwork for their
  future integration as decision support tools in multidisciplinary medical contexts.
