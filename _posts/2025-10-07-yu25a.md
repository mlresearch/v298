title: 'LEAVES: Learning Views for Time-Series Biobehavioral Data in Contrastive Learning'
abstract: Contrastive learning has been utilized as a promising self-supervised learning
  approach to extract meaningful representations from unlabeled data. The majority
  of these methods take advantage of data-augmentation techniques to create diverse
  views from the original input. However, optimizing augmentations and their parameters
  for generating more effective views in contrastive learning frameworks is often
  resource-intensive and time-consuming. While several strategies have been proposed
  for automatically generating new views in computer vision, research in other domains,
  such as time-series biobehavioral data, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce
  a simple yet powerful module for automatic view generation in contrastive learning
  frameworks applied to time-series biobehavioral data, which is essential for modern
  health care, termed **lea**rning **v**i**e**ws for time-**s**eries data (LEAVES).
  This proposed module employs adversarial training to learn augmentation hyperparameters
  within contrastive learning frameworks. We assess the efficacy of our method on
  multiple time-series datasets using two well-known contrastive learning frameworks,
  namely SimCLR and BYOL. Across four diverse biobehavioral datasets, LEAVES requires
  only  20 learnable parameters—dramatically fewer than the  580,000 parameters demanded
  by frameworks like ViewMaker, previously proposed adversarially trained convolutional
  module in contrastive learning, while achieving competitive and often superior performance
  to existing baseline methods. Crucially, these efficiency gains are obtained without
  extensive manual hyperparameter tuning, which makes LEAVES particularly suitable
  for large-scale or real-time healthcare applications that demand both accuracy and
  practicality.
