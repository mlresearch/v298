title: Switching State Space Modeling via Constrained Inference for Clinical Outcome
  Prediction
abstract: 'In clinical settings, timely and accurate prediction of adverse patient
  outcomes can help guide treatment decisions. While deep learning models such as
  LSTMs have demonstrated strong predictive performance on multivariate clinical time
  series, they often lack interpretability. To address this gap, we propose a framework
  that combines the predictive strength of neural networks with the interpretability
  of latent variable models. Specifically, we develop a constrained inference approach
  to train a switching state space model—an autoregressive hidden Markov model (AR-HMM)—for
  outcome prediction. Our method leverages knowledge distillation: a high-capacity
  LSTM "teacher" model is first trained to predict a target clinical outcome of interest,
  and its predictive behavior is then transferred to an interpretable AR-HMM "student"
  model through a similarity constraint during inference. We implement a constrained
  variational inference approach to estimate the parameters of the student model while
  aligning its latent representations with that of the teacher model’s. We evaluated
  our approach using two real-world clinical datasets. Our approach demonstrates predictive
  performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning models, while producing
  interpretable latent trajectories that reflect clinically meaningful patient states.'
