title: 'ADHAM: Additive Deep Hazard Analysis Mixtures for Interpretable Survival Regression'
abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event outcomes
  in healthcare. Recent advances have introduced flexible neural network approaches
  for improved predictive performances. However, these models do not provide interpretable
  insights into the association between exposures and the modeled outcomes, a critical
  requirement for decision-making in clinical practice. To address this limitation,
  we propose Additive Deep Hazard Analysis Mixtures (ADHAM), an interpretable additive
  survival model. ADHAM assumes a conditional latent subpopulation structure that
  characterizes an individual, combined with covariate-specific hazard functions.
  To select the number of subpopulations, we introduce a post-training group refinement-based
  model-selection procedure; \ie an efficient approach to merge similar clusters to
  reduce the number of repetitive latent subpopulations identified by the model. We
  perform comprehensive studies to demonstrate ADHAM’s interpretability on population,
  subpopulation, and individual levels. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
  show that ADHAM provides novel insights into the association between exposures and
  outcomes. Further, ADHAM remains on par with existing state-of-the-art survival
  baselines, offering a scalable and interpretable approach to time-to-event prediction
  in healthcare.
