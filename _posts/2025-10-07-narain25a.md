title: Improving ARDS Diagnosis Through Context-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models
abstract: The digitization of medical data has opened the door for AI to improve healthcare
  delivery, but the opaque nature of AI technologies presents challenges for interpretability,
  which is crucial in clinical settings. Previous work has attempted to explain predictions
  using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable concepts or feature
  groupings that map to higher-level clinical ideas, such as disease severity, facilitating
  human evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations
  when the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. In our study,
  we demonstrate the importance of incorporating contextual information from clinical
  notes to improve CBM performance, particularly in characterizing Acute Respiratory
  Distress Syndrome (ARDS), using data from MIMIC-IV. Our approach leverages a Large
  Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional concepts,
  boosting accuracy by up to 10% compared to existing methods. This method also enables
  learning more comprehensive concepts, reducing the risk of information leakage and
  reliance on spurious shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.
