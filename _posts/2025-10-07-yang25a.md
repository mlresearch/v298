title: 'The Geometry of Queries: Query-Based Innovations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  for Healthcare QA'
abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare question answering
  requires robust methods to ensure accuracy and reliability. This work introduces
  Query-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation (QB-RAG), a framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG) systems in healthcare question-answering by pre-aligning user queries
  with a database of curated, answerable questions derived from healthcare content.
  A key component of QB-RAG is an LLM-based filtering mechanism that ensures that
  only relevant and answerable questions are included in the database, enabling reliable
  reference query generation at scale. We establish a theoretical foundation for QB-RAG,
  provide a comparative analysis of existing retrieval enhancement techniques, and
  introduce a generalizable, comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses both
  the retrieval effectiveness and the quality of the generated response based on faithfulness,
  relevance, and adherence to the guideline. Our empirical evaluation on a healthcare
  data set demonstrates the superior performance of QB-RAG compared to existing retrieval
  methods, highlighting its practical value in building trustworthy digital health
  applications for health question-answering.
