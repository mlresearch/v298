title: Generating Accurate Synthetic Survival Data by Conditioning on Outcomes
abstract: Synthetically generated data can improve privacy, fairness, and data accessibility;
  however, it can be challenging in specialized scenarios such as survival analysis.
  One key challenge in this setting is censoring, i.e., the timing of an event is
  unknown in some cases. Existing methods struggle to accurately reproduce the distributions
  of both observed and censored event times when generating synthetic data. We propose
  a conceptually simple approach that generates covariates conditioned on event times
  and censoring indicators by leveraging existing tabular data generation models without
  making assumptions about the mechanism underlying censoring. Experiments on real-world
  datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and improves
  downstream survival model performance.
