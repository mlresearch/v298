title: State-of-the-Art Text-Prompted Medical Segmentation Models Struggle to Ground
  Chest CT Findings
abstract: This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art text-prompted
  segmentation models, including SAM2, MedSAM2, SegVol, SAT, and BiomedParse, on ReXGrounding,
  a novel dataset that pairs chest CT findings with corresponding segmentation masks.
  Our results demonstrate that despite recent advances, current models struggle to
  accurately segment diverse findings from chest CTs, particularly when dealing with
  non-focal abnormalities described in natural language reports. While existing models
  are primarily optimized for fixed categorical labels rather than nuanced clinical
  descriptions, even fine-tuning these models with free-text descriptions yields limited
  improvement in segmentation accuracy. These insights highlight that report grounding
  on 3D medical volumes through segmentation remains an open challenge, necessitating
  future models that better comprehend complex clinical language and irregular object
  patterns across volumetric data.
