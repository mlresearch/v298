title: 'Clinicians’ Voice: Fundamental Considerations for XAI in Healthcare'
abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) holds the promise of advancing the implementation and
  adoption of AI-based tools in practice, especially in high-stakes environments like
  healthcare. However, most of the current research lacks input from end users, and
  therefore their practical value is limited. To address this, we conducted semi-structured
  interviews with clinicians to discuss their thoughts, hopes, and concerns. Clinicians
  from our sample generally think positively about developing AI-based tools for clinical
  practice, but they have concerns about how these will fit into their workflow and
  how it will impact clinician-patient relations. We further identify training of
  clinicians on AI as a crucial factor for the success of AI in healthcare and highlight
  aspects clinicians are looking for in (X)AI-based tools. In contrast to other studies,
  we take on a holistic and exploratory perspective to identify general requirements
  for (X)AI products for healthcare before moving on to testing specific tools.
