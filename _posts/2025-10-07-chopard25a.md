title: 'Towards Scalable Newborn Screening: Automated General Movement Assessment
  in Uncontrolled Settings'
abstract: General movements (GMs) are spontaneous, coordinated body movements in infants
  that offer valuable insights into the developing nervous system. Assessed through
  the Prechtl GM Assessment (GMA), GMs are reliable predictors for neurodevelopmental
  disorders. However, GMA requires specifically trained clinicians, who are limited
  in number. To scale up newborn screening, there is a need for an algorithm that
  can automatically classify GMs from infant video recordings. This data poses challenges,
  including variability in recording length, device type, and setting, with each video
  coarsely annotated for overall movement quality. In this work, we introduce a tool
  for extracting features from these recordings and explore various machine learning
  techniques for automated GM classification.
