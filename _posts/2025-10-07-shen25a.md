title: 'Stepwise Fine and Gray: Subject-Specific Variable Selection Shows When Hemodynamic
  Data Improves Prognostication of Comatose Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients'
abstract: Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical
  challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical information
  that informs prognostication is collected serially over time. Shortly after cardiac
  arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are collected (e.g., demographics,
  cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU admission, additional features are gathered,
  including time-varying hemodynamic data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor
  medications). We view these as two phases in which we collect new features. In this
  study, we propose a novel stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the
  prediction of neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage
  of time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).
  A key finding is that it is not always beneficial to use all features (first and
  second phase) for prediction. Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second
  phase (time-varying hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and
  also *when* this information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data
  for a patient over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies).
  Our approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two
  phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear
  feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose post-arrest
  patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance for the competing
  outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, and death despite
  maximal support. Subgroup analyses based on the motor component of the FOUR score
  reveal that patients with severe neurological dysfunction receive minimal additional
  prognostic benefit from hemodynamic data, whereas those with moderate-to-mild impairment
  derive significant incremental risk information. These findings underscore the potential
  of dynamic risk modeling for enhancing prognostication. Our approach generalizes
  to more than two phases in which new features are collected and could be used in
  other dynamic prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom
  newly collected features significantly improve prediction.
