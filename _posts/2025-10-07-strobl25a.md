title: Predicting the Predictable in the Psychiatric High Risk
abstract: 'Most investigators in precision psychiatry force models to predict clinically
  meaningful but ultimately predefined outcomes in a high-risk population. We instead
  advocate for an alternative approach: let the data reveal which symptoms are predictable
  with high accuracy and then assess whether those predictable symptoms warrant early
  intervention. We correspondingly introduce the Sparse Canonical Outcome REgression
  (SCORE) algorithm, which combines items from clinical rating scales into severity
  scores that maximize predictability across time. Our findings show that this simple
  shift in perspective significantly boosts prognostic accuracy, uncovering predictable
  symptom profiles such as social difficulties and stress-paranoia from those at clinical
  high risk for psychosis, and social passivity from infants at genetic high risk
  for autism. The predictable scores differ markedly from conventional clinical metrics
  and offer clinicians memorable, actionable insights even when full diagnostic criteria
  are unmet. An R implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SCORE-B06C.'
