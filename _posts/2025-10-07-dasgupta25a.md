title: 'Learning to Call: A Field Trial of a Collaborative Bandit Algorithm for Optimizing
  Call Timing in Mobile Maternal Health'
abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver
  health information, particularly targeting underserved communities, demonstrating
  the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate crucial health information
  to these populations, improving health outcomes through increased awareness and
  behavioral change. India’s Kilkari program delivers vital maternal health information
  via weekly voice calls to millions of mothers. However, the current random call
  scheduling often results in missed calls and reduced message delivery. This study
  presents a field trial of a collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize
  call timing by learning individual mothers’ preferred call times. We deployed the
  algorithm with  6500 Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance
  to the baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically
  significant improvement in call pickup rates with the bandit algorithm, indicating
  its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of mothers across
  India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized scheduling in mobile
  health interventions and underscores the potential of machine learning to improve
  maternal health outreach at scale.
